title: Known Issues

There are some known issues at this time, and while none of these render the language unworkable in any real way, these are things that're good to know before diving in real deep.

1. The core Hachi library needs to be manually moved to /usr/lib/hachi.
    
    - This will be addressed in future releases.

2. Namespace clashing in imported packages.
    - This is annoying, but workable and will be addressed in future releases.
